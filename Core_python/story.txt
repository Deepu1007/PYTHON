Once upon a time, there was a little rabbit named Ruby who loved her toys very much. She had a bright red ball, a soft teddy bear, and a shiny toy car. One sunny day, Ruby noticed that her toys looked sad because they wanted to play outside. So, she decided to take them to the meadow. Ruby rolled the ball, raced the car, and had a picnic with her teddy bear. They all had so much fun together! Ruby realized that playing outside with her toys made them happy, and from that day on, she always took them on adventures, sharing joy and laughter in the beautiful meadow.
